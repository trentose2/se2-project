## Coding conventions

For code consistency and cleaner `diff`, please set your editor to do the following:

- always leave (only) one empty line at the end of files
- remove trailing whitespaces
- use Unix (LF) line endings

To accomplish that, in VSCode you can add the following lines to your `settings.json` file:

```
    "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
    "files.trimFinalNewlines": true,
    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
```
