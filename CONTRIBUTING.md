## Coding conventions

For code consistency and cleaner `diff`, please add the following lines to your `settings.json` file in Visual Studio Code:

```
"files.insertFinalNewline": true,
"files.trimFinalNewlines": true,
"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
```

or equivalent settings in your preferred editor.
